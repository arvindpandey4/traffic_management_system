Traffic Management System
Team Cirrus created this in under 24 hours at the SRM SDG Hackathon. It integrates Open CV with an external landing page to identify car clusters on a lane. The system includes computerized traffic lights for vehicle stopping. The team completed this with consideration for the traffic on the SRM campus, and they were awarded 20,000 INR for third place.
